# conU Build Plan

This is the living execution plan for conU. Future agents must update this file when a phase is completed or materially changed.

## Update Rules For Agents

At the end of each completed phase, update:

- phase status
- summary of completed work
- files changed
- validation run
- known gaps
- recommended next phase

Do not mark a phase complete unless the implementation exists and validation was attempted. If validation cannot run, record why.

Status values:

```txt
not_started
in_progress
blocked
completed
needs_revision
```

## Current Status

```txt
Current phase: Phase 7 - Pairing And Trust
Status: not_started
Last updated: 2026-05-10
```

## Phase 0 - Project Memory

Status: completed

Goal:

- `Cargo.lock`
- `README.md`
- `crates/conu-cli/Cargo.toml`
- `crates/conu-cli/src/main.rs`
- `crates/conu-core/Cargo.toml`
- `crates/conu-core/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/conu-protocol/Cargo.toml`
- `crates/conu-protocol/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/conu-relay/Cargo.toml`
- `crates/conu-relay/src/main.rs`
- `crates/conud/Cargo.toml`
- `crates/conud/src/main.rs`

- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu run -p conud -- --check` passed.
- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu run -p conu-relay -- --check` passed.

Known gaps:

- Default MSVC `cargo test` and `cargo run` fail locally because Visual Studio C++ Build Tools / `link.exe` are not installed.
- Phase 1 intentionally avoids clap, Tokio, tracing, and serde until linker support or CI validation is available.
- No real daemon, IPC, relay networking, or persistent state exists yet.

Next:

- Start Phase 2: CLI identity and dashboard.

## Phase 2 - CLI Identity And Dashboard

Status: completed

Goal:

Build the first advanced CLI shell with ASCII identity, status layout, and production command structure.

Commands:

```txt

conu connect
conu watch
```

Exit criteria:

- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu run -p conu-cli -- status --json` passed.
- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu run -p conu-cli -- agents` passed.
- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu run -p conu-cli -- pair` passed.
- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu run -p conu-cli -- join 482913` passed.

- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu run -p conu-cli -- start` passed.

Known gaps:

- No real local identity is created; that remains Phase 3.
- No real daemon lifecycle is implemented; that remains Phase 4.
- No real local agent registration exists; that remains Phase 5.
- Pairing/join are command-shape previews only; trust creation remains Phase 7.
- Watch shows a static transport view only; live animation remains Phase 10.

Next:

- Start Phase 3: local identity, config, trust store skeleton, and safe state path resolution.

Files changed:

- `README.md`
- `.agents/repo/ABOUT.md`
- `.agents/skills/conu-builder/references/implementation-guardrails.md`
- `plan.md`
- `crates/conu-cli/src/lib.rs`

- `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` passed.
- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu test --workspace` passed.
- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu run -p conu-cli -- init` passed with isolated `CONU_HOME`.
- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu run -p conu-cli -- init` passed a second time and preserved the same node id.
- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu run -p conu-cli -- status` passed with isolated `CONU_HOME`.
- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu run -p conu-cli -- status --json` passed with isolated `CONU_HOME`.
- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu run -p conu-cli -- agents --json` passed with isolated `CONU_HOME`.

Known gaps:

- Phase 3 node id is a local identifier only, not a cryptographic identity or authentication credential.
- No private keys, signed identities, encrypted mailbox, or key storage exists yet; those remain Phase 11 hardening work.
- No real daemon lifecycle exists yet; that remains Phase 4.
- No local agent registration exists yet; that remains Phase 5.
- Trust store and agent registry are skeleton files only until pairing/registration phases.

Next:

- Start Phase 4: conUD daemon skeleton with runtime state, health/status detection, graceful shutdown, and payload-safe logs.

## Phase 4 - conUD Daemon Skeleton

Status: completed

Goal:

Create the local runtime daemon that will own routing, sessions, identity, and agent connections.

Deliverables:

- Added tests for runtime acquire, already-running guard, stop request, stopped cleanup, stale replacement, CLI runtime status, start already-running path, and stop request path.
- Updated README, repo overview, and implementation guardrails.

Files changed:

- `README.md`
- `.agents/repo/ABOUT.md`
- `.agents/skills/conu-builder/references/implementation-guardrails.md`
- `plan.md`
- `crates/conu-cli/src/lib.rs`

- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu run -p conu-cli -- status --json` reported running runtime metadata.
- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu run -p conu-cli -- stop` requested graceful shutdown and observed stopped state.
- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu run -p conud -- --once` passed.
- Smoke log review confirmed only metadata lines with `payload=not_observed`.

Known gaps:

- Phase 4 health is file-backed heartbeat metadata, not real IPC.
- `conu start` needs an installed/sibling `conud` binary or `CONUD_EXE` in development.
- There is no local agent registration yet; that remains Phase 5.
- There is no message routing, transport encryption session, relay, or remote discovery yet.
- Runtime logs are std-only text metadata and do not yet have rotation or structured logging.

Next:

- Start Phase 5: local IPC transport and agent registration with payload-safe agent registry updates.

## Phase 5 - Local IPC And Agent Registration

Status: completed

Goal:

Let local agents register with conUD through a local gateway.

Deliverables:

- [x] local IPC transport

- Persisted local agent records in `agents/registry.toml` with id, display name, node id, kind, presence, last seen time, and capability booleans.
- Integrated conUD serve loop and `conud --process-ipc` with gateway request processing.
- Updated `conu agents`, `conu agents --json`, `conu agents register`, and `conu agents heartbeat`.
- Updated `conu status` and dashboard output with local IPC and local agent count.
- Added payload-safe `logs/agents.log` metadata lines with `payload=not_observed`.
- Hardened rejected IPC request errors so arbitrary request contents are not echoed into rejection reasons.
- Updated README, repo overview, builder guardrails, and agent gateway contract.

- Smoke follow-up confirmed `conu agents --json` showed `presence: busy`.
- Smoke log review confirmed `logs/agents.log` contains only metadata lines with `payload=not_observed`.
- `conud --process-ipc` passed after daemon stop with no pending requests.
- Explicit process check confirmed no `conud` process remained running after smoke.

Known gaps:

- Phase 5 IPC is file-backed for reliability and visibility; it is not yet named pipes, Unix sockets, or binary framed IPC.
- The gateway only supports registration and presence. Message send/receive starts in Phase 6.
- Agent capabilities are basic booleans only; policy grants and signed agent cards arrive in later trust/security phases.
- There is no remote discovery or relay integration yet.

Next:

- Start Phase 6: local opaque envelope messaging with sender/receiver validation, local inbox, and delivery metadata that never displays payload contents.

## Phase 6 - Opaque Envelope Messaging

Status: completed

Goal:

Implement local opaque message envelopes and local send/receive routing.

Deliverables:

- [x] envelope type
- [x] message id
- [x] sender/receiver validation
- [x] local inbox
- [x] delivery receipt skeleton

Exit criteria:

- [x] One local agent can send an opaque payload to another local agent.
- [x] CLI can show delivery metadata without showing payload.

Completed work:

- Created GitHub issue #11 for Phase 6.
- Created and pushed branch `codex/phase-6-opaque-messaging`.
- Added std-only `conu_core::messages` local message routing module.
- Added file-backed message request queue under `runtime/ipc/messages/`.
- Added recipient inbox storage under `messages/inbox/<agent-id>/`.
- Added metadata-only delivery receipts under `messages/receipts/`.
- Added sender and recipient validation against the local registered agent registry.
- Added `conu messages send <from-agent> <to-agent> --stdin`.
- Added `conu messages inbox <agent-id>` and JSON output.
- Added `conu messages receipts` and JSON output.
- Wired conUD serve loop, `conud --once`, and `conud --process-ipc` to process local message requests.
- Added payload-safe `logs/messages.log` metadata lines with `payload=not_observed`.
- Ensured processed and rejected message request markers do not keep or display payload contents.
- Updated README, repo overview, builder guardrails, repo map, and agent gateway contract.

- `crates/conu-core/src/runtime.rs`
- `crates/conu-core/src/state.rs`
- `crates/conud/src/main.rs`

Validation:

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` passed.
- `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` passed.
- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu test --workspace` passed.
- `cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu build -p conud -p conu-cli` passed.
- Live isolated `CONU_HOME` smoke passed: `conu init`, `conu start`, two `conu agents register` calls, `conu messages send agent.sender agent.receiver --stdin`, `conu messages inbox agent.receiver --json`, `conu messages receipts --json`, `conu stop`, and `conud --process-ipc`.
- Smoke confirmed delivery status `delivered`, recipient inbox metadata, `delivered_local` receipt metadata, and `logs/messages.log` with `payload=not_observed`.
- Explicit process check confirmed no `conud` process remained running after smoke.

Known gaps:

- Phase 6 is local-only; there is no remote relay, remote discovery, pairing, streams, rooms, or pub/sub yet.
- Message payload bytes are stored as opaque local recipient-inbox envelope data, not displayed or logged. Encryption hardening and encrypted mailbox storage remain Phase 11 work.
- The CLI can submit from stdin and list metadata, but SDK/MCP receive APIs arrive in Phase 12.
- File-backed message IPC is intentionally simple; named pipes, Unix sockets, and binary framed IPC remain future production upgrades.

Next:

- Start Phase 7: pairing and trust records between runtimes, including code lifecycle, trust entry persistence, and revocation/listing groundwork.
